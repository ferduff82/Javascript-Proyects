									Planning to visit Las Vegas or any other vacational resort where casinos are a major portion of their. business? I have just the thing for you. Here, I will show you how to pass off as a High Roller and collect many. complimentary items and gifts.
									What is the Secret?
									The Secret is that you have to make them believe you are rich and love gambling. In short you have to impersonate a High Roller.  Why?
									Hotels love high rollers because these players leave behind thousands of dollars each visit. And the real cool part about this is that if you act the role, casinos will lavish you with the same gifts and complimentary items that a real High Roller would receive.
